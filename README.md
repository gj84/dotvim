# vimrc

 My **personal** Vim configuration. Incremental changes aiming to keep it simple and understandable.

* If something is **simple** (a map, a setting) -->  config.
* If something is **"relatively complex"** --> a vim script.
* If something is **really amazing** --> 3rd part pluggin.

I am using and removing several plugins either via packages or minpac, for so just I'm keeping it the simplest way.
